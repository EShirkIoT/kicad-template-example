# Cookiecutter KiCad

## Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Cookiecutter KiCad generates boilerplate for production-ready [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org) projects.

## Features

The project you create from this template has a few features to be aware of
including:

* A [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project structure to get you going

## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a hardware widget called "some widget". Rather than manually 
creating the project directory structures, get cookiecutter to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

``` bash
pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"`
```

Now run it against this repo:

``` bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/madeinoz67/cookiecutter-kicad
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a project structure will be created for you.

Warning: After this point, change 'Fred Smith', 'fsmith', etc to your own
information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired options. For example:

``` bash
Cloning into 'cookiecutter-kicad'...

7 - CERN-OHL-P
Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 [1]:
github_user [my_github_user]: fsmith
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

``` bash
cd some-widget/
ls -a
```

Create a git repo and push it there:

``` bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial project commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:fsmith/wireless-widget.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Open KiCad and open the project

If you have performed the steps above, you should now be able to open KiCad and open the new project.
